## Documentation ##
See [The Integration Guide](integrating.md) to integrate with your driver.

The documentation can be rendered into HTML with doxygen. Run `doxygen ./doc/Doxygen`, then open `./doc/html/index.html`.

## Building libmongocrypt ##

On Windows and macOS, libmongocrypt can use the platform's default encryption
APIs as its encryption backend. On other systems, one will want to install the
OpenSSL development libraries, which libmongocrypt will use as the default
encryption backend.

Then build libmongocrypt:

```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt
cd libmongocrypt
mkdir cmake-build && cd cmake-build
cmake ../
make
```

This builds libmongocrypt.dylib and test-libmongocrypt, in the cmake-build
directory.

## Installing libmongocrypt on macOS ##
Install the latest release of libmongocrypt with the following.
```
brew install mongodb/brew/libmongocrypt
```

To install the latest unstable development version of libmongocrypt, use `brew install mongodb/brew/libmongocrypt --HEAD`. Do not use the unstable version of libmongocrypt in a production environment.

## Building libmongocrypt from source on macOS ##

First install [Homebrew according to its own instructions](https://brew.sh/).

Install the XCode Command Line Tools:
```
xcode-select --install
```

Then clone and build libmongocrypt:
```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt.git
cd libmongocrypt
cmake .
cmake --build . --target install
```

Then, libmongocrypt can be used with pkg-config:
```
pkg-config libmongocrypt --libs --cflags
```

Or use cmake's `find_package`:
```
find_package (mongocrypt)
# Then link against mongo::mongocrypt
```

## Installing libmongocrypt on Windows ##
A Windows DLL for x86_64 is available on the Github Releases page. See the [latest release](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/releases/latest).

Use `gpg` to verify the signature. The public key for `libmongocrypt` is available on https://pgp.mongodb.com/.


### Testing ###
`test-mongocrypt` mocks all I/O with files stored in the `test/data` and `test/example` directories. Run `test-mongocrypt` from the source directory:

```
cd libmongocrypt
./cmake-build/test-mongocrypt
```

libmongocrypt is continuously built and published on evergreen. Submit patch builds to this evergreen project when making changes to test on supported platforms.
The latest tarball containing libmongocrypt built on all supported variants is [published here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/libmongocrypt/all/master/latest/libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz).

### Troubleshooting ###
If OpenSSL is installed in a non-default directory, pass `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/openssl` to the cmake command for libmongocrypt.

If there are errors with cmake configuration, send the set of steps you performed to the maintainers of this project.

If there are compilation or linker errors, run `make` again, setting `VERBOSE=1` in the environment or on the command line (which shows exact compile and link commands), and send the output to the maintainers of this project.

### Design Principles ###
The design of libmongocrypt adheres to these principles.

#### Easy to integrate ####
The main reason behind creating a C library is to make it easier for drivers to support FLE. Some consequences of this principle: the API is minimal, structs are opaque, and global initialization is lazy.

#### Lightweight ####
We decided against the "have libmongocrypt do everything" approach because it complicated integration, especially with async drivers. Because of this we decided no I/O occurs in libmongocrypt.

### Releasing ###

See [releasing](./doc/releasing.md).

## Installing libmongocrypt From Distribution Packages ##
Distribution packages (i.e., .deb/.rpm) are built and published for several Linux distributions.  The installation of these packages for supported platforms is documented here.

### Unstable Development Distribution Packages ###
To install the latest unstable development package, change `1.10` to `development` in the package URLs listed in the subsequent instructions. For example, `https://libmongocrypt.s3.amazonaws.com/apt/ubuntu <release>/libmongocrypt/1.10` in the instructions would become `https://libmongocrypt.s3.amazonaws.com/apt/ubuntu <release>/libmongocrypt/development`. Do not use the unstable version of libmongocrypt in a production environment.

### .deb Packages (Debian and Ubuntu) ###

First, import the public key used to sign the package repositories:

```
sudo sh -c 'curl -s --location https://pgp.mongodb.com/libmongocrypt.asc | gpg --dearmor >/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/libmongocrypt.gpg'
```

Second, create a list entry for the repository.  For Ubuntu systems (be sure to change `<release>` to `xenial`, `bionic`, `focal`, or `jammy`, as appropriate to your system):

```
echo "deb https://libmongocrypt.s3.amazonaws.com/apt/ubuntu <release>/libmongocrypt/1.10 universe" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libmongocrypt.list
```

For Debian systems (be sure to change `<release>` to `stretch`, `buster`, `bullseye`, or `bookworm` as appropriate to your system):

```
echo "deb https://libmongocrypt.s3.amazonaws.com/apt/debian <release>/libmongocrypt/1.10 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libmongocrypt.list
```

Third, update the package cache:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Finally, install the libmongocrypt packages:

```
sudo apt-get install -y libmongocrypt-dev
```
