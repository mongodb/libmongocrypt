MongoDB Client Encryption
=========================

The Node.js wrapper for [`libmongocrypt`](../../README.md)

### Installation

You can install `mongodb-client-encryption` with the following:

```bash
npm install mongodb-client-encryption
```

### Development
#### Setup

Run the following command to build libmongocrypt and setup the node bindings for development:

```shell
bash ./etc/build-static.sh
```


#### Testing

Some tests require a standalone server to be running with authentication enabled.  Set up a single
server running with the following conditions:

| param     | value     |
|-----------|-----------|
| host      | localhost |
| port      | 27017     |

This is the standard setup for a standalone server with no authentication.

Run the test suite using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deprecation Notice

There are breaking changes planned for this package.  In the next major version, callbacks will be removed
from the public API on all asynchronous functions.  Additionally, the classes documented here will be
moved into [node-mongodb-native](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native).
