About
=====

Python wrapper library for libmongocrypt that supports client side encryption
in drivers. PyMongoCrypt uses `cffi <https://pypi.org/project/cffi/>`_ and
`cryptography <https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/>`_.

PyMongoCrypt supports Python 3.7+ and PyPy3.7+.

Security Vulnerabilities
------------------------

If you've identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the `instructions here
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`_.

Installation
============

PyMongoCrypt can be installed with `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::

  $ python -m pip install pymongocrypt
  $ python -c "import pymongocrypt; print(pymongocrypt.libmongocrypt_version())"
  1.2.1


PyMongoCrypt ships wheels for macOS, Windows, and manylinux2010 that include
an embedded libmongocrypt build.

Installing from wheels on Linux requires pip 19 or later because it adds
`support for manylinux2010 wheels <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id108>`_.
Older versions of pip will attempt installation using the
pymongocrypt-X.Y.tar.gz source distribution which requires the extra step of
downloading and installing libmongocrypt as described below.
Users can upgrade to pip 19 by running::

  $ python -m pip install --upgrade 'pip>=19'

Installing from source
----------------------

Installing from source (or the pymongocrypt-X.Y.tar.gz source distribution,
or pip < 19 on Linux) requires an extra step of installing libmongocrypt.
First, install PyMongoCrypt from source::

  $ git clone git@github.com:mongodb/libmongocrypt.git
  $ python -m pip install ./libmongocrypt/bindings/python

Next, install libmongocrypt.

libmongocrypt is continuously built and published on evergreen.
The latest tarball containing libmongocrypt built on all supported variants is
`published here <https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/libmongocrypt/all/master/latest/libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz>`_.
Download and extract ``libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz`` and set
``PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB`` to the path to your operating system's libmongocrypt.so file.
For example::

  $ curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/libmongocrypt/all/master/latest/libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz
  $ mkdir libmongocrypt-all && tar xzf libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz -C libmongocrypt-all
  $ ls libmongocrypt-all

macOS::

  $ # Set PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB for macOS:
  $ export PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB=$(pwd)/libmongocrypt-all/macos/nocrypto/lib/libmongocrypt.dylib
  $ python -c "import pymongocrypt; print(pymongocrypt.libmongocrypt_version())"
  1.2.1

Windows::

  $ # Set PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB for Windows:
  $ chmod +x $(pwd)/libmongocrypt-all/windows-test/nocrypto/bin/mongocrypt.dll
  $ export PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB=$(pwd)/libmongocrypt-all/windows-test/nocrypto/bin/mongocrypt.dll
  $ python -c "import pymongocrypt; print(pymongocrypt.libmongocrypt_version())"
  1.2.1

Linux::

  $ # Set PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB for RHEL 6.2 x86_64:
  $ export PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB=$(pwd)/libmongocrypt-all/rhel-62-64-bit/nocrypto/lib64/libmongocrypt.so
  $ python -c "import pymongocrypt; print(pymongocrypt.libmongocrypt_version())"
  1.2.1

Dependencies
============

PyMongoCrypt supports Python 3.7+ and PyPy3.7+.

PyMongoCrypt requires `cffi <https://pypi.org/project/cffi/>`_ and
`cryptography <https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/>`_.

If not installed using one of the official wheels, PyMongoCrypt also requires
libmongocrypt to be installed on your system. If libmongocrypt is not
installed you will see an error like this:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import pymongocrypt
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "pymongocrypt/__init__.py", line 15, in <module>
      from pymongocrypt.binding import libmongocrypt_version, lib
    File "pymongocrypt/binding.py", line 803, in <module>
      lib = ffi.dlopen(os.environ.get('PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB', 'mongocrypt'))
    File "/.../lib/python3.7/site-packages/cffi/api.py", line 146, in dlopen
      lib, function_cache = _make_ffi_library(self, name, flags)
    File "/.../lib/python3.7/site-packages/cffi/api.py", line 828, in _make_ffi_library
      backendlib = _load_backend_lib(backend, libname, flags)
    File "/.../lib/python3.7/site-packages/cffi/api.py", line 823, in _load_backend_lib
      raise OSError(msg)
  OSError: ctypes.util.find_library() did not manage to locate a library called 'mongocrypt'


Use the ``PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB`` environment variable to load a locally installed
libmongocrypt build without relying on platform specific library path environment
variables, like ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. For example::

  $ export PYMONGOCRYPT_LIB='/path/to/libmongocrypt.so'
  $ python -c "import pymongocrypt; print(pymongocrypt.libmongocrypt_version())"
  1.2.1

Testing
=======

The easiest way to run the tests is to run **python setup.py test** in
the root of the distribution.
